/// Counterpart: `identity-resolution.schema.json#/$defs/service_route_projection`.
/// Derived route projection of one verified service DID state.
///
/// This is the single Rust expression of
/// `identity-resolution.schema.json#/$defs/service_route_projection`
/// (`sync/service-surface.md` Â§2.6). It is produced either locally by
/// [`AuthenticatedServiceResolution::projection`] after method-native
/// verification, or handed over already verified inside an own-Station result
/// such as the media service binding. There is deliberately only one type: a
/// second "wire-only" copy would let a consumer accept a route the local
/// verifier would have rejected.
///
/// Every coordinate comes from the verified method-native state and its unique
/// `ArkretService` entry. The projection creates no signed address history and
/// carries no method evidence.
